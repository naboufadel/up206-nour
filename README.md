## Introduction
Hello, my name is Nour Aboufadel and I'm a first year in the MURP/MPH dual degree program. My area of concentration is Environmental Analysis and Policy (EAP). I have a background in Envrionmental Science and Public Health. I'm interested in learning more about the intersection of Urban Planning and Public Health and working towards finding solutions that incorporate both fields. I'm specifically interested in looking at environmental factors and exposures that impact our health.


## Goals/Objecives for class
I'm familiar with the basiscs of GIS, through ESRI, and so I would like to learn more about GIS and Spatial Analysis through other mediums. Through this class, I hope to learn more about coding and how I can use that in spatial analysis. I would also like to learn how to effectively convey urban planning and public health topics through GIS in a way that is accessible to everyone. 

## Project Ideas
I don't have any specific project in mind. I think I would be able to narrow my search the more I learn about the class and my capabilities through coding, but so far I'm interested in: 
- Identifying sources of environmental pollution and the communities that are at higher risk of illnesses due to exposure.
- Prevalence of certain diseases in a community over time and possible sources.
